# Upbound Spaces Reference Platform

This repository contains a reference Upbound Spaces Configuration for
[Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/). It's a great starting point for
building a self hosted spaces cluster in AWS, GCP, or Azure.

This platform offers APIs for setting up a fully configured Upbound Spaces
cluster in your cloud provider of choice, with managed kubernetes  secure
networking, and a GitOps System.
